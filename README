Project features:
 - Terrain mapped planet utilizes a vertex shader to alter surface topography. Regions of higher intensity in the texture are mapped to higher elevations on the planet.
 - Water on planet utilizes a reflective shader and alpha blending transparency
 - Orbiting sun casts specular highlights on water surface and diffuse highlights on planet surface 
 - Rotating clouds utilizes blending and transparency using shader
 - Procedurally generated fractal tree (Lindenmayer system) is hidden inside planet.
 - Can cycle through planet textures using left/right keys
 - Can toggle clouds with 'c' keyboard press
 - Can change terrain severity using up/down keys

Design Decisions:
 - repurposed bloom lab and shapes code
 - implemented user commands to interact with the graphics
 - implemented fractal tree algorithm, included an example of the algorithm in a chamber within our planet
 - altered shape geometry and color computations mostly within shaders, so as to make use of GPU

NOTE: Use CS123_final.pro to build the program. Disregard bloom_lab.pro... removing it seems to cause compiler problems for our code
